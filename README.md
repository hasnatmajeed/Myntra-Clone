# Myntra-Clone
This project is a front-end clone of the Myntra website, built using pure HTML and CSS. It replicates the layout, design, and styling of Myntra's main page to practice and showcase front-end development skills. The project is fully responsive and demonstrates the use of Flexbox, grid layouts, and modern CSS techniques.
